        <h3>Liability</h3>
        <p>
          Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an 'as
          is' basis. To the extent permitted by law, INTRODUCE GURU makes no
          warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all
          other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or
          conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
          non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation of
          rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          In no event shall INTRODUCE GURU or its suppliers be liable for any
          consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party
          arising from the use or inability to use this website or the materials
          on this website, even if INTRODUCE GURU or an authorized
          representative has been notified, orally or in writing, of the
          possibility of such damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context of this agreement, “consequential loss” includes any
          consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss of profit,
          loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of goodwill,
          loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use
          and/or loss or corruption of data, whether under statute, contract,
          equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity, or otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
          warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
          incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
        </p>

        <h2>Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
        <p>
          This acceptable use policy covers the products, services, and
          technologies (collectively referred to as the “Products”) provided by
          INTRODUCE GURU under any ongoing agreement. It’s designed to protect
          us, our customers, and the general Internet community from unethical,
          irresponsible, and illegal activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          INTRODUCE GURU customers found engaging in activities prohibited by
          this acceptable use policy can be liable for service suspension and
          account termination. In extreme cases, we may be legally obliged to
          report such customers to the relevant authorities.
        </p>
        <p>This policy was last reviewed on 28 October 2021.</p>
        <h3>Fair use</h3>
        <p>
          We provide our facilities with the assumption your use will be
          “business as usual”, as per our offer schedule. If your use is
          considered to be excessive, then additional fees may be charged, or
          capacity may be restricted.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are opposed to all forms of abuse, discrimination, rights
          infringement, and/or any action that harms or disadvantages any group,
          individual, or resource. We expect our customers and, where
          applicable, their users (“end-users”) to likewise engage our Products
          with similar intent.
        </p>
        <h3>Customer accountability</h3>
        <p>
          We regard our customers as being responsible for their own actions as
          well as for the actions of anyone using our Products with the
          customer’s permission. This responsibility also applies to anyone
          using our Products on an unauthorized basis as a result of the
          customer’s failure to put in place reasonable security measures.
        </p>
        <p>
          By accepting Products from us, our customers agree to ensure adherence
          to this policy on behalf of anyone using the Products as their end
          users. Complaints regarding the actions of customers or their
          end-users will be forwarded to the nominated contact for the account
          in question.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a customer — or their end-user or anyone using our Products as a
          result of the customer — violates our acceptable use policy, we
          reserve the right to terminate any Products associated with the
          offending account or the account itself or take any remedial or
          preventative action we deem appropriate, without notice. To the extent
          permitted by law, no credit will be available for interruptions of
          service resulting from any violation of our acceptable use policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Prohibited activity</h3>
        <h4>Copyright infringement and access to unauthorized material</h4>
        <p>
          Our Products must not be used to transmit, distribute or store any
          material in violation of any applicable law. This includes but isn’t
          limited to:
        </p>
        <ol className='list-disc ml-4'>

            any material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, or
            other intellectual property right used without proper authorization,
            and
          </li>
          <li>
            any material that is obscene, defamatory, constitutes an illegal
            threat or violates export control laws.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The customer is solely responsible for all material they input,
          upload, disseminate, transmit, create or publish through or on our
          Products, and for obtaining legal permission to use any works included
          in such material.
        </p>
        <h4>SPAM and unauthorized message activity</h4>
        <p>
          Our Products must not be used for the purpose of sending unsolicited
          bulk or commercial messages in violation of the laws and regulations
          applicable to your jurisdiction (“spam”). This includes but isn’t
          limited to sending spam, soliciting customers from spam sent from
          other service providers, and collecting replies to spam sent from
          other service providers.

        <p>
          Our Products must not be used for the purpose of running unconfirmed
          mailing lists or telephone number lists (“messaging lists”). This
          includes but isn’t limited to subscribing email addresses or telephone
          numbers to any messaging list without the permission of the email
          address or telephone number owner, and storing any email addresses or

          or hosted by our Products must be “confirmed opt-in”. Verification of
          the address or telephone number owner’s express permission must be
          available for the lifespan of the messaging list.
        </p>
        <p>
          We prohibit the use of email lists, telephone number lists or
          databases purchased from third parties intended for spam or
          unconfirmed messaging list purposes on our Products.
        </p>
        <p>
          This spam and unauthorized message activity policy applies to messages
          sent using our Products, or to messages sent from any network by the
          customer or any person on the customer’s behalf, that directly or

          transmitting, or otherwise making available any software, program,
          product, or service designed to violate this acceptable use policy, or
          the acceptable use policy of other service providers. This includes
          but isn’t limited to facilitating the means to send spam and the
          initiation of network sniffing, pinging, packet spoofing, flooding,
          mail-bombing, and denial-of-service attacks.
